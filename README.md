Buy Bitcoin, gives user a form and allows them to make a trade with their dollar and bitcoin balance updating.

Implementation:
Node and create-react-app running concurrently

React fetches Node endpoint, Node then gets last price from Bitfinex API and returns it to React.
Price is set only on start.

Future additions: Bitfinex API websocket for price data
